# Chapter 1: Introduction

### Key terms

- **Procedural abstraction:**  Hiding the details of implementation of the particular function and allowing the user to view at high level
- **Abstract data type:** Logical description of data on how to view it and operations instead of focussing on the actual implementation. Concerned with data representation not with construction. Idea is encapsulating the details of implementation a.k.a **information hiding**
